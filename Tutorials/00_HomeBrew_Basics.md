# Working with HomeBrew

## What is [HomeBrew][1]]?
  It is a package manager. It is used to install packages that are NOT provided
  by Apple. This is an useful utility to install various utilities and port
  linux projects or develop on MAC.

## How to [install and uninstall][2]?
  Its a command-line utility.
### Install HomeBrew
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
  The script installs:
  `
  /usr/local/bin/brew
  /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
  /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
  /usr/local/Homebrew
  `

  and creates the following directories:
  `/usr/local/bin
  /usr/local/etc
  /usr/local/include
  /usr/local/lib
  /usr/local/sbin
  /usr/local/share
  /usr/local/var
  /usr/local/opt
  /usr/local/share/zsh
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
  /usr/local/var/homebrew
  /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked
  /usr/local/Cellar
  /usr/local/Caskroom
  /usr/local/Frameworks
  `
  
### Uninstall HomeBrew
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

HomeBrew keeps all its installation under /usr/local.
