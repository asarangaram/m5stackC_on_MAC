# [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf):


**Created from my notes while setting up environment for working on `M5Stack C`**

This page explains how to install [ESP-IDF from github][1] and setup it to build
and run the projects. Focus is on to setup it from terminal.

There are methods to setup and use it from VS code or Eclipse. Refer
appropriate documentation for it if required.
Most of the documentations are up to date for Linux, while lagging on MacOS.

## Important Notes

* Decide on which version to start with from [here][2]. This decision is based
on which chip you have. I am using ESP32. Other available chips as
on **May 2021** are ESP32 S2 and ESP32 C3.
* Refer [ESP-IDF Programming Guide][3] for up to date info. It is simple to
  follow
* The info in this page are tested on [M5Stack C]
* This procedure is for `MacOS 11.3.1 ESP-IDF v4.2.1`

## Steps
  Switch to bash terminal, if you are in zsh. Most of the steps we use
  works fine in bash, not zsh.

### Pre-requisites
  Check which Python is default. As python 2 is deprecated, it is better we
  switch to python 3.

  ```bash
  $ python --version
  Python 2.7.16
  ```

  MacOS also has python3 pre-installed.
  ```bash
  $ python3 --version
  Python 3.8.2
  ```
  As this version is good enough, we don't install python, instead
  create an alias so that python point to python3 in our bash environment.

  ```bash
  $ alias python=python3 # Add this line into .bashrc
  $ python --version
  Python 3.8.2
  ```
  We also need pip. The macOS system has pip3, but it may not have been aliased
  to pip. Let's setup alias and check version. (you may also create softlink)

  ```bash
  $ alias pip="python -m pip" #A dd this line into .bashrc
  $ pip --version
  pip 21.1.1 from /Library/Python/3.8/site-packages/pip (python 3.8)
  ```
  Install HomeBrew, if you have not done earlier.
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  ```
  The script installs:
  `
  /usr/local/bin/brew
  /usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
  /usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
  /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
  /usr/local/Homebrew
  `

  and creates the following directories:
  `/usr/local/bin
  /usr/local/etc
  /usr/local/include
  /usr/local/lib
  /usr/local/sbin
  /usr/local/share
  /usr/local/var
  /usr/local/opt
  /usr/local/share/zsh
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
  /usr/local/var/homebrew
  /usr/local/var/homebrew/linked
  /usr/local/Cellar
  /usr/local/Caskroom
  /usr/local/Frameworks
  `

  Using HomeBrew, install the following packages.

  ```bash
  brew install cmake ninja dfu-util ccache
  ```
  **Note:** HomeBrew installs latest version of Python3 as needed and point to it
  when you install other packages, so, always watch which version is being used.
  you may continue using the version given by HomeBrew as long as it satisfies
  the requirement.

  Connect your device into the USB port of the Mac. The driver for CP210x
  already exists on MacOS, no need to install it again.  
  Try,
  ```bash
  $ ls -1 /dev/cu.*
  ...
  /dev/cu.usbserial-5952CA19FA
  ```


### Download and Install
  Close the ESP-IDF from its github path into a work-dir.
  ```bash
  $ mkdir ~/esp
  $ cd ~/esp
  $ git clone -b v4.2.1 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
  ```
  Note, I am downloading **v4.2.1**, and also note `--recursive`

  ```bash

  ```
  This script is designed such that it first installed `xtensa-esp32-elf` into
  `~/.espressif` folder, then installed dependency packages as listed in
  `~/esp/esp-idf/requirements.txt`. It creates a Python VENV.

  When ever you want to use this setup, you should do the following

  ```bash
  $ export IDF_PATH=~/esp/esp-idf
  $ source $IDF_PATH/export.sh
  ```

### Verify
  Now to confirm that the tools works as expect, let us compile a example program.

  ```bash
  mkdir ~/esp/workdir
  cd ~/esp/workdir
  cp -rf $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world ./
  cd hello_world
  idf.py menuconfig
  ```

  This menuconfig is default, and may not really the final one. So, Don't
  Modify anything. We only verify the build system

  ```bash
  idf.py build
  ```

  Once the build completes, it will end with instruction for flashing.
  We can't copy paste the command instead, we need to edit to update
  the port and baud rate to the device we have.

  /Users/work/.espressif/python_env/idf4.2_py3.9_env/bin/python ../../components/esptool_py/esptool/esptool.py **-p /dev/tty.usbserial-5952CA19FA  -b 150000** --before default_reset --after hard_reset --chip esp32  write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size detect --flash_freq 40m 0x1000 build/bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x8000 build/partition_table/partition-table.bin 0x10000 build/hello-world.bin

  Now open a Serial port Monitor. Remember you need to press Ctrl+] to quit.

  ```bash
  $ idf.py monitor -p /dev/tty.usbserial-5952CA19FA

  This confirms that the hello world works correctly on the ESP32 device.
  you don't see anything on the onboard display as it is not used in this
  example project.

  Next session, lets explore more examples.
